# Robot War Game
This is an assignment I had done with my university groupmates in 2024 using C++. It is a Robot War Game that spawns several types of robots in a mxn grid. The robots have different movement based on their type, and they will move randomly in the grid and destroy each other. The game finishes when the battlefield (grid) is left with one robot only.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) (with a C/C++ compiler installed, e.g., MinGW or GCC)

### Running the Project

1. Open Code::Blocks.
2. Go to **File > Open** and select the `.cbp` project file **TC3L_G18_A2.cbp**.
3. Click **Build** (gear icon) to compile the project.
4. Click **Run** (green triangle icon) to execute the program.

Alternatively, you can press **F9** to build and run at once.

### Notes

- If you encounter errors, check the build messages for missing libraries or incorrect paths.

- If you want to open it in other IDE, you can move the **main.cpp** alongside **ALL** other **.h files** to your own folder. You can change the .txt file name to your own in the code (just make sure all the files exists and located in the same folder).
