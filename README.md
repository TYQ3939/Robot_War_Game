# Robot_War_Game
This is an assignment I had done with my university groupmates in 2024 using C++. It is a Robot War Game that spawns several types of robots in a mxn grid. The robots have different movement based on their type, and they will move randomly in the grid and destroy each other. The game finishes when the battlefield (grid) is left with one robot only.
